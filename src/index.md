Greetings, I'm Alex Elkin a Frontend Web Developer, mentor, and freelancer. I have a passion for designing contemporary, user-friendly websites and interfaces.

With over six years of development experience, my journey began with frontend development for Content Management Systems. I later ventured into complex interface design within the gambling and financial sectors.

My true passion, however, lies in JAM-stack. That's why this website is built on 11ty, utilizing server-side rendering to ensure a minimal load on visitors' devices. (Technically, the site is currently undergoing updates, and you can track the progress on my GitHub).

This website serves as my online presence. Here, you can explore my portfolio, discover the technologies I work with, access my resume, get a glimpse into my non-work-related interests, and, in the future, read my original articles on development, which I am currently planning to write.

Feel free to reach out if you have any inquiries or would like to explore my work further. Thanks for visiting!
